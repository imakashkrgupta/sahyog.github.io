    <p>
        The vision of our project is to make a platform where anyone from any region of our country can access life-saving informations in case of an emergency . <br><br>

Suppose person A faced an accident and get senseless , after a while person B saw 
the victim lying on the road , he/she immediately took the victim to nearby hospital 
but there was no facility of immediate intensive care unit I.C.U. , as a result person lost his/her life and the reason was non availability of I.C.U. this is just one example .
In India, 1214 road accidents occurs a day , 377 people die everyday due to road crashes .  <br><br>

In order to save the life of all those victims , our group CODERSQUAD has created 
SAHYOG the website which contains every possible informations, updates, locations, health-care advices etc. that can be accessed by any person in most conveinient and simple way so that everyone can easily understand it, SAHYOG will provide the proper information that will be helpful to identify, which hospitals, health-care units,nursing homes,clinics etc. are currently having the availability of sufficient beds, I.C.U. wards,medical facilities such as heart transplant, dialysis, E.C.G, C.T. scan, internal and external body parts surgeries etc. Not just these 
SAHYOG will give proper details of all the doctors of a particular region with their 
basic informations, specialities, schedules, location where they practice, their recent 
patients count, some of their known medical achievements etc.  <br><br>

Now imagine the above mentioned example as you are person C you have been using SAHYOG and you know better than anyone that at the time of accident which hospitals are available with proper health-care facilities . After that you took the victim to that particular hospital and his/her life gets save .
 <br><br>
We are living in society where everyone is busy in their aspects,family,career,work etc. just think of those persons who lost their lives just because of unavailability of proper health-care facilities at the right time, it feels sad . 
 <br><br>
Every lives matter and humanity is the biggest religion ,
For the sake of humanity we have created SAHYOG to
give help & support to all . <br><br>
