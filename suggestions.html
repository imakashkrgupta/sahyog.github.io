        <span>Cold</span> <br> <br>
        Most cases of the common cold get better without treatment, usually within a week to 10 days. But a cough may linger for a few more days. The best thing you can do is take care of yourself
 while your body heals. For example, drink plenty of liquids, humidify the air, use saline nasal rinses and get adequate rest. <br> <br> <br>

        1.	Cover the injured eye with a clean eye pad or wound dressing. If there is a large foreign body lodged in the eye, DO NOT attempt to remove it, but pad around the eye socket to avoid pressure. <br> <br>
2.	Advise the patient to keep the uninjured eye closed if possible to reduce the risk of movement of the injured eye <br> <br> <br>

        1.	Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes as soon as possible after the injury. Never use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter. <br> <br>

3.	Cover the burn with cling film. Put the cling film in a layer over the burn, rather than wrapping it around a limb. A clean clear plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand<br> <br> <br>
